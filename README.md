firstToken||ETH_PROOF_BEGINNER|| Here I've been submititing my project of ETH PROOF:BEGINNER provided by Metacrafter.

<h1>Description</h1>

In this solidity program we can represent some functionalitis like minting and burning our tokens from balaces.
As they have just taught me how to create my own token I'll try my best to provide you more projects on this solidity course.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Executing Program</h3>
1.Mint Function will take two parameters an address and value and it will be insreasing the total supply and balance of sender address.

2.Burn Function will work opposite of mint function as it will deduct the value from total supply and from the balance of sender.

3.When user wants to check their balance they can enter thier address.
